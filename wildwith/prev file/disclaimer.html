    <h2>Earnings Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Building a business takes time, hard work, and continuous learning. There is no guarantee that you will see the exact same results as I have seen over the years.</p>

    <p>WE HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO ACCURATELY REPRESENT OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE REPRESENTATION OF THE POTENTIAL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS SUBJECT TO OUR INTERPRETATION.</p>

    <p>WHILE THE EARNINGS POTENTIAL FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT USE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS USUALLY VERY ENCOURAGING. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR EARNING POTENTIAL IS SUBJECT TO MANY INDEPENDENT FACTORS, ALL OF WHICH VARY FROM INDIVIDUAL TO INDIVIDUAL AND ARE OFTEN OUT OF ANY INDIVIDUAL’S CONTROL.</p>

    <p>AS SUCH, WE MAKE NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE OF ANY KIND THAT YOU WILL EXPERIENCE ANY SPECIFIC LEVEL OF EARNINGS BY USING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ANY EXAMPLES WE HAVE PROVIDED SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS ANY GUARANTEE OF EARNINGS. WE DO NOT ASSERT THAT OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES REPRESENT A “GET RICH SCHEME.” UPON REQUEST, WE MAY ASSIST YOU IN THE VERIFICATION OF CLAIMS OF ACTUAL EARNINGS AND/OR EXAMPLES OF ACTUAL RESULTS ACHIEVED, THOUGH WE ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO DO SO.</p>

    <p>HOWEVER, WE CANNOT AND DO NOT OFFER YOU ANY DIRECT FINANCIAL ADVICE, NOR ARE WE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FINANCIAL DECISIONS YOU MAKE. AS ALWAYS, IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO DISCUSS THE LEGALITY OR FINANCIAL SOUNDNESS OF ANY DECISION YOU MAKE WITH A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL BEFORE MAKING SUCH A DECISION.</p>

    <h2>Affiliate Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Certain products/services and links to products/services are affiliate links, and I may earn a commission for any purchases that you make. Occasionally, I am compensated to give my honest opinion on products and/or services. This will not incur additional cost to you.</p>

    <p>I mention these products and services to you because I believe in them and want to help you improve your life. I only recommend products or services that I feel deliver value to you. With full disclosure, of course, topusa.online is a for-profit business, which means I do earn an income with this website.</p>

    <p>To make it easy on the both of us, you should assume that any links leading you to products or services are affiliate links and that I will receive commission from your purchase.</p>

    <p>All efforts are made to ensure that affiliate links are disclosed in accordance with the FTC.</p>

    <p>We are also affiliated with Amazon and other e-commerce websites. We make some revenue when you buy after clicking our links (at no extra cost to you).</p>

    <p>But our views are not biased just because we make affiliate money.</p>

    <p>We do our best effort to provide you the authentic information.</p>
